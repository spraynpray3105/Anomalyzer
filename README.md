**Anomalyzer** is a lightweight, deployable anomaly detection system designed to make advanced cybersecurity accessible to small and medium businesses without the need for massive infrastructure or costly enterprise solutions. It is the culmination of my desire to contribute to innovation in computer science, particularly in the field of anomaly detection.

The goal of Anomalyzer is to provide an **easy-to-deploy, baseline-aware monitoring system** that adapts to local network traffic patterns while conforming to industry standards.

## Vision
Small and medium businesses often struggle to acquire cost-effective cybersecurity solutions. Large corporate providers frequently require heavy infrastructure and ongoing maintenance. **Anomalyzer aims to fill this gap** by providing a system that is lightweight, easy to deploy, and effective in detecting network anomalies.

---

## Current Status
Anomalyzer is in the **early stages of development**. Initial models are being trained and tested on local network traffic, with the aim of creating a self-contained anomaly detection system that is adaptive, easy to deploy, and interpretable. Future updates will document model performance and feature extraction processes.
